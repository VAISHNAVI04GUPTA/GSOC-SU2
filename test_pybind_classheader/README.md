#In this we have:
created a class(Calculation) in the header file
defined a function arithmetic which has function body in cpp file wherein we are using a python function also.
a python file has function definition where we are taking an integer as an input argument which is the output from multiply fxn in cpp file, and calculating its factorial.
The whole binding is done through a module named calc, which has to defined in a separate cpp file (bindings.cpp)
